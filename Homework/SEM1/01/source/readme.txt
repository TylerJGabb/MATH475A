This readme briefly introduces how to use my code

in the commandline type:

python3 binRepr.py @NUMBERS

Where @NUMBERS is a file containing base 10 floats and ints on separate lines

NOTE:

file format must look like so

123
456
678

A NOTE TO THE TEACHER:

I regret to say that I waited to long to begin the analysis and was unable to complete it.

Rather than include a half-done solution, I decided to submit the code without the analysis.

Sorry Professor...
